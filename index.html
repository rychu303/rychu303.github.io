          <p>Hello! My name is Richard, and I'm excited to share my work with you!</p>

          <p>A few years back, I made the transition from being an English teacher living overseas to managing website projects for a tech company in Denver. My curiosity about how the internet works was cultivated during my time working in project
            management, and within the past year, I decided to go full steam ahead and delve deep into the world of web development.</p>

              <p>At Convercent/OneTrust, I worked on a team with other CMS Technical Specialist to build ethics and compliance portals for many large clients. Once the Alpha program for our Speak Up Program was completed, I had the pleasure of
                building out the Speak Up site for the Southampton Football Club.</p>

              <p>The Speak Up pages were largely templated, but I had to use both existing print brand guidelines and inspiration from the client's existing site to complete this build. It was an interesting and fun design challenge to try and match
                the SFC's new Speak Up brand with our existing SUP template.</p>

              <p>This site was built off of Acquia's Site Studio platform using the proprietary customized CMS owned by OneTrust. It's built to be fully responsive and accessible.</p>

              <p>My client and owner of the Parakletos Osteopathic Clinic needed to migrate his website off of GoDaddy's legacy CMS platform onto their new CMS platform in a timely manner. This project required me to not only migrate all of the
                content and assets, but I also had to work with the client on completely redesigning the website using GoDaddy's new templates and components.</p>

              <p>Some customization was requied to add elements such as the black banners with quotes on the top and bottom of some pages as well as a large table, all of which were customized to be more mobile friendly.</p>

              <p>In addition to the build, I also supplied a number of new photo assets for the client by doing a couple days of photo shoots and editing those photos for the site. We also built out a brand new user-authenticated portal for students
                as well as added new content specific to skateboarding-related injuries and treatment.</p>

              <p>This site was built and customized using GoDaddy's Website Builder.</p>

              <p>Tindog is a fake promotional app page I built as an assignment for a full-stack developer bootcamp that I am currently taking. We were tasked with duplicating the design of the page as closely as possible from scratch.</p>

              <p>While much of the page was built out manually using HTML and CSS in my Atom text editor, we were also tasked with utilizing Bootstrap 5 to bring in some of the key elements, such as the main navigation and price package cards listed
                at the bottom of the page. It was during this project that I started to learn how to tie in Font Awesome fonts and custom font libraries as well as utilize properties like z-index and various flex properties built within Bootstrap to
                make a completely scalable and responsive single webpage from scratch.</p>

              <p>Part of this work required me to get new assets for the site, which meant I had to shoot and edit new photos for our updated pages. Many of the assets on the site today are ones that I provided.</p>

              <p>Along with new assets, I did fairly heavy redesigns to the homepage and, in particular, the staff and resources pages. I added more interactivity with more buttons and hover links, and I made all these pages more responsive for
                mobile users. I also helped fix issues with the main navigation, udpated/added webforms to a couple of the pages, and I did some custom work on the homepage to make the links in the navigation squares more accessible.</p>

              <p>Skatuary.com is built on the ExpressEngine CMS platform.</p>

              <img src="images/best-buy-homepage.png" alt="Best Buy speakup homepage screenshot">

              <p>Best Buy was another client that I worked with during my time at Convercent/OneTrust. This project was unique in that Best Buy wanted a Speak Up site, but they wanted it to be more customized and have an extra page with additional
                resources. They were moving off the platform of their previous web hosting partner and wanted to maintain as many of the assets and content as possibe.</p>

              <p>Part of the challenge of this build was trying to reference the client's existing and out-of-date ethics and compliance website to build something more modern and on brand. I used inspiration from their corporate and retail websites,
                and I took some creative liberties of my own to incororate the added imagery and quotes on the pages. I also had to modify the existing SUP template to accommodate the client's need to move the CEO video message to a different page.
                This required a lot of custom style changes to the homepage cards to ensure they were still mobile responsive across multiple devices.</p>

              <p>Yet another challenge to this project was the fact that the Client needed multiple translated versions of each page, and every resource had to be linked separately to a new language-specific resource.</p>

              <p>This webiste was built one OneTrust's customized version of Acquia's Site Studio CMS platform.</p>

              <p>I spent a little over 4 years helping local and state Colorado government entitites create their websites on the Colorado.gov CMS platform. A large part of my role was to provide training to our various partners as I guided them
                through successful completion of their website projects.</p>

              <p>When we began major efforts to migrate all our existing customers off of Drupal 7 onto Drupal 8, I was tasked with creating brand new training pages and videos for our partners. Before I left my position as Associate Project Manager,
                I took it upon myself to revamp and redesign the training pages to make it easier for our partners to find the information they needed to support their Colorado.gov websites.</p>

              <p>While I was not able to complete my initiative before leaving my position for new opportunities, I was able to nearly finish the "beginner" level set of courses. With some help from my fellow teammate, I redesigned, rewrote,
                restructured, and, in some cases, re-recorded and edited new training videos for the introductory courses.</p>

              <p>Linked to this page is the Beginner Courses landing page. Not only did I help structure and rebuild/redesign this page, I created the content for and built all the training pages listed. </p>

              <p>At the time of the project, these pages were built on Tyler Technologies NIC Division's own custom version of Drupal 8.</p>
